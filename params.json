We will provide forked copies of existing projects that are regularly updated and also host code directly.  We hope this space can also serve both as a launching spot for finding all the code others have written and as a common development area where new packages can be designed.  \r\n\r\nIf you have code you'd like to contribute or would like to join the group or a specific team, please contact @jsgosnell or @thefaylab\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
