We will provide forked copies of existing projects that are regularly updated and also host code directly.  We hope this space can also serve both as a launching spot for finding all the code others have written and as a common development area where new packages can be designed.  \r\n\r\n### General organization set-up\r\n\r\nIf you have code you'd like to contribute or would like to join the group or a specific team, please contact @jsgosnell or @thefaylab\r\n\r\n### Current packages and relation to Atlantis workflow\r\n\r\n## Developing input files\r\n\r\n**ratlantis **- functions to generate bgm file and run Atlantis from R console, gather data on species trait, interactions, and distribution from the cloud, suggest functional groupings, and generate the bio.prm file\r\n\r\n## Tuning and visualization\r\n\r\n**vat ** - code for shiny application to visualize Atlantis output\r\n\r\n## Data processing\r\n\r\n**atlantisom ** - functions to generate data sets from atlantis scenarios\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
