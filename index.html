<p>r4atlantis is meant to be your link to code for developing, executing, and comparing Atlantis models in R. We will provide forked copies of existing projects that are regularly updated and also host code directly.  We hope this space can also serve both as a launching spot for finding all the code others have written and as a common development area where new packages can be designed.  </p>

<p>If you have code you'd like to contribute or would like to join the group or a specific team, please contact <a href="https://github.com/jsgosnell" class="user-mention">@jsgosnell</a> or <a href="https://github.com/thefaylab" class="user-mention">@thefaylab</a></p>
